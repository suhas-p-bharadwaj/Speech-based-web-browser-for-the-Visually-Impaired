          Provides clean ruby syntax for defining messy cron jobs and running them Whenever.
            &mdash; 
This URL has Read+Write accessWhenever is a Ruby gem that provides a clear syntax for writing and deploying cron jobs.Or with Bundler in your Gemfile.This will create an initial "config/schedule.rb" file you.More examples on the wiki: Whenever ships with three pre-defined job types: command, runner, and rake. You can define your own with job_type.For example:Would run /usr/local/bin/awesome party extreme every two hours. :task is always replaced with the first argument, and any additional :whatevers are replaced with the options passed in or by variables that have been defined with set.The default job types that ship with Whenever are defined like so:If a script/rails file is detected (like in a Rails 3 app), runner will be defined to fit:If a :path is not set it will default to the directory in which whenever was executed. :environment will default to 'production'. :output will be replaced with your output redirection settings which you can read more about here: All jobs are by default run with bash -l -c 'command...'. Among other things, this allows your cron jobs to play nice with RVM by loading the entire environment instead of cron's somewhat limited environment. Read more: You can change this by setting your own :job_template.Or set the job_template to nil to have your jobs execute normally.And you'll see your schedule.rb converted to cron sytax. Note: running whenever with no options does not display your current crontab file, it simply shows you the output of converting your schedule.rb file.Use the built-in Capistrano recipe for easy crontab updates with deploys.In your "config/deploy.rb" file:Take a look at the recipe for options you can set. 
For example, if you're using bundler do this:This will simply show you your schedule.rb file converted to cron syntax. It does not read or write your crontab file. Run whenever --help for a complete list of options.Whenever was created for use at Inkling (Thanks to all the contributors who have made it even better: For general discussion and questions, please use the google group: If you've found a genuine bug or issue, please use the Issues section on github: Ryan Bates created a great Railscast about Whenever:
