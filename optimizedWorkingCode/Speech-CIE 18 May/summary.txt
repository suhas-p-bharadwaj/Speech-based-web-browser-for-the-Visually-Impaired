Portal:Learning ProjectsWikiversity has adopted the "learning by doing" model for education.  Lessons should center on learning activities for Wikiversity participants.  Learning materials and learning projects can be used by multiple departments.  Cooperate with other departments that use the same learning resource.Learning materials and learning projects are located in the main Wikiversity namespace.  Simply make a link to the name of the lesson (lessons are independent pages in the main namespace) and start writing!The histories of Wikiversity pages indicate who the active participants are.  If you are an active participant in this department, you can list your name here (this can help small departments grow and the participants communicate better; for large departments a list of active participants is not needed).
