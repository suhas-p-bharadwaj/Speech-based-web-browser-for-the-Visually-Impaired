Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809&#160;– April 15, 1865) was the 16th President of the United States, serving from March 1861 until his assassination.  As president, he led the country through a great constitutional, military and moral crisis—the American Civil War—preserving the Union while ending slavery and promoting economic modernization.  He became a country lawyer, an Illinois state legislator, and a one-term member of the United States House of Representatives but failed in two attempts at a seat in the United States Senate.  He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children.After deftly opposing the expansion of slavery in the United States in his campaign debates and speeches, Lincoln secured the Republican nomination and was elected president in 1860.  He issued his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoted the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, abolishing slavery.Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including the commanding general and future president, Ulysses S. Grant.  He brought leaders of ious factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate.  Each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865.  A shrewd politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, he reached out to War Democrats and managed his own re-election in the 1864 presidential election.As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, Lincoln came under attack from all sides.  In 1816, the Lincoln family lost their lands because of a faulty title and made a new start in Perry County, Indiana (now Spencer County).  On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter from his law practice in Springfield, suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship.
